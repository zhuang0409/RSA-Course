# RSA-Course
This is the courseware for RSA class. The goal of this class is to enable students to analyze neuroimaging data with RSA method. Therefore, the course includes the basis of matlab, RSA theory and more importantly hands-on RSA.

There are several programs that we kindly ask you to download before the course. Please install them on your laptops or computers. 

1.	Matlab (preferably one of the latest versions (we use 2019)
2.	CoSMoMVPA ( https://www.cosmomvpa.org/download.html ) and tutorial data with AK6 data 
3.	BrainNet Viewer ( https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/ ) 

Schedule:

Theoretical background
1. Introduction to RSA
2. Introduction to behavioral/neuroimaging experiments
3. Introduction to computational models (DNNs)

Hands-on sessions
1. Standard whole-brain RSA
2. Standard ROI-based RSA
3. Regression-based whole-brain RSA
4. Regression-based ROI-based RSA
5. Statistics
6. BrainNet Viewer for brain map visualization

Please be aware that some knowledge of programming in MATLAB is recommended to join the course.
